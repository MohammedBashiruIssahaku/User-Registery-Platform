Project: User Registry Platform
Overview: The User Registry Platform is a backend application built using the Spring Boot framework, designed to manage user data with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. This project serves as a fundamental system for storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting user information, showcasing a well-organized backend structure and the practical implementation of essential database operations.

Core Features:

User Management:

Allows for the creation of new user profiles with relevant details (e.g., name, email, phone number, address).
Supports retrieval of user data, enabling the display of information for each user by unique identifiers.
Facilitates updates to existing user profiles, allowing for the modification of details as needed.
Provides functionality to delete users from the database as required.
CRUD Operations:

Each endpoint is dedicated to performing one of the CRUD operations, ensuring modular and easy-to-maintain code.
Robust error handling ensures smooth operation, with meaningful error messages for cases like missing or invalid data.
Database Integration:

Utilizes a relational database to store user information, with Spring Data JPA for seamless database interaction.
Includes a well-defined entity model for user data, and mapping between the database and application.
API Design:

Follows RESTful principles, making the API intuitive and accessible for frontend integration or further development.
Each operation is accessed via a specific endpoint, such as /users for listing users, /users/{id} for specific user details, etc.
Technologies Used:

Spring Boot: For building the applicationâ€™s core logic and structure.
Spring Data JPA: For database management and ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to simplify data persistence.
MySQL/PostgreSQL/H2 (or another relational database): For storing and retrieving user data.
Maven: For managing project dependencies.
Postman (or similar tool): For testing and verifying API endpoints.
